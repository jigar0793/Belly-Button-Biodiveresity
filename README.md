# Belly-Button-Biodiveresity

## Overview of the Project

This project creates a dashboard that contains belly button bacteria information from different people. This information is helpful for a synthetic beef making company since they can look at the bacteria data and identify belly button bacterias which would aid them in the synthetic beef making.


By using different charts and demographic information, the dashboard displays bacterial information in the belly button of different volunteers and helps identify essential bacteria for synthetic beef making.

## Result

The dashboard contains three charts:

1. A bar chart showing the top 10 bacterial species and the number of samples found in the belly button.
2. A bubble chart showing all the bacterias in the belly button of a selected test subject.
3. A gauge chart showing the frequency of washing the belly button per week per individual.
4. There is also a dropdown menu with a demographic information panel. When a test subject id is selected from the menu, all the graphs are populated with relevant information.

## Summary

The dashboard presents belly button bacterial data successfully.
